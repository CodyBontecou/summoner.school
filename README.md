# summoner.school

I decided to take [The Learn Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) approach to validating an app idea that I have.
This code is currently being hosted on Netlify at [summonerschool.netlify.app](summonerschool.netlify.app).

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
